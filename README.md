# Welcome, everyone.

This is the code for the "Dynamic websites for Artists" workshop.

It's designed to go along with [these slides](http://www.slideshare.net/workergnome/dynamic-websites-for-artists).

It's a workshop on quick-and-dirty dynamic websites for artists.  The workshop covers how to build and host a basic website that accepts user data, saves it, manipulates it, and displays it back.  

The workshop covers the basics of using Sinatra, Redis, and Heroku. It uses the Dropbox integration feature of Heroku to deploy sites quickly (and without using git).

Basic HTML knowledge is required, and a passing familiarity with the command line will be very useful.
